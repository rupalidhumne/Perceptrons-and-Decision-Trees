# Perceptrons-and-Decision-Trees
Practice with Perceptrons and Decision Trees

1) Developed a Decision Tree that I trained and used to classify peoples' political affiliations. Used alpha-beta pruning technique for the tree in this process. 

2) Identified the number of boolean functions a perceptron can learn given "n" variables.

3) Developed a Perceptron and Decision tree that were used on a training size of 100 vectors and test set of 10 boolean inputs (with f(x) as the majority function)
